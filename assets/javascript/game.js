//Pseudo Code:
//There are 4 crystals displayed as buttons
//Generate a random number at start of game for player between 19-120
//Player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to palyers total (hidden values change for each game)
//The amount is hidden until the crystal is clicked (hidden value between 1-12)
//Player's score is updated after each click
//Player wins if their score matches random number
//Player loses if their score goes over random number
//Game resets after each win/lose
//Page shows wins & losses total
